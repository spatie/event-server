## Installation

Don't install this yet!

## Usage

The goal of this package is to have a long-running PHP process with the whole application state in memory. This means you don't need a database or ORM. The application state is built from events stored on the server, hence the whole application is event sourced.

### Architecture

On the one hand there's a server (`php console.php server`), which will build its state from stored events on startup. After it's booted, the server is accessible via socket connections for PHP clients to work with.

In the current test suite, these clients are simple PHP scripts, though they could very well be a Laravel or Symfony application.

Events are sent from these PHP clients to the server, which will store and apply them. Furthermore, the clients can request parts of the server's state via a gateway. This server-client communication is best shown with an example:

```php
// The server is run in the background, all previously stored events are loaded into memory
$server->run();

// A client can make a new aggregate and apply events on it, these events are sent to the server
$aggregate = new TestAggregate();
$aggregate->increase(10);

// When a new request comes in, this aggregate can be resolved from the event server
$aggregate = TestAggregate::find($uuid);
```

There's also support for projections and reactors (process managers). But the setup is far from complete. Here's a non-definitive list of what's missing:

- Resolving projections from the server
- Snapshot support: which is essential to speed up server startup performance
- Proper data store support: if you, for example, want to do complex queries on aggregates
- Versioning support: allowing code changes to events, aggregates and what not
- Maybe GraphQL is a viable approach to sync data between the event server and its clients
- â€¦

## Potential benefits

The application state is always loaded in memory, which means that there's much less overhead compared to using a normal data store and an ORM. Performance problems like eager loading issues and cyclic relations simply don't exist.

Furthermore, it has the potential to significantly improve the performance of PHP clients, since they become relatively "dumb", they only need to execute simple controller code, do some request validation, etc.

This architecture also promotes a clear boundary between application- and domain code, both can be separately worked on and tested.
